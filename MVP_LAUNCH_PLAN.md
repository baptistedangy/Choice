- **MVP Fix**: User-friendly error messages with retry options
- **Impact**: Better user experience when APIs are down

### 3. **Add Usage Analytics** (Medium Priority)
- Track menu scans, recommendation clicks, user preferences
- Understand user behavior for future improvements
- Simple Google Analytics or Mixpanel integration

### 4. **Performance Optimizations** (Medium Priority)
- Add loading states for better perceived performance
- Optimize image compression before OCR
- Cache user preferences locally

### 5. **Basic User Feedback** (Low Priority)
- Simple thumbs up/down on recommendations
- Optional feedback form
- Help improve AI recommendations over time
